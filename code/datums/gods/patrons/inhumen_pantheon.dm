		It was he who taught the early Dark Elves to bend the world to their will. Once a mortal, Zizo undertook the same method that Psydon did and descended into the deepest pits of hell. \
		However, alike Psydon and their Holy Children, the Divine Pantheon of The Ten, in Zizo's efforts to forcefully obtain Godhood he had created new Gods of his own, that being Gragger, Matthios and Baotha. \
		Further consequences of his forceful attempt of Godhood had also cursed the Snow Elves, creating the Dark Elves that were forced to be the first followers of Zizo and his unholy children creating the Inhuman Pantheon. \
		He is the God of Necromancy, and Left-Handed Magicks. Zizo is worshipped by necromancers, warlocks, and the undead. \
		His worshippers proclaim that one day, Zizo will ascend the trillion steps of hell and personally lead the damned and the dead to claim the world for himself. \
		It is said that the very utterance of his name will bring about misfortune. Zizo is depicted as a pale elf, the only piece of clothing on his body being a black cloak which wraps around his lithe form like darkness. \
		On his head is a hood, starting from the eyes and extending up like a steeple."

		He is depicted as a man with spikes coming out of his grinning head, his right eye impaled on one of these spikes which came through the eyesocket, the other eye staring with malice, all above a mouth which never stops grinning. \

		She is the Goddess of Degeneracy, Debauchery, and Addiction. The slaves once brought down to their homes were used as fodder, fighting the creatures which often times attacked their home. Now these slaves are used in gladiatorial bouts and as servants in Dark Elf homes. \
		The Dark Elves have surrendered themselves to this hedonism, their slaves bringing them high shelf bottles of the finest alcohol ever made just so they can use it to wash down the chuckledust they've been snorting all day. \
		It is this same hedonism that Baotha attempts to spread across the world, those who worship her are perverts, gamblers, drunkards and bards. \
